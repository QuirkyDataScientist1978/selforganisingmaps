# Self-organizing map
This contains the files related to implementations of self organizing maps in Python.

Self Organising Maps refer to an unsupervised machine learning algorithm which can also be used for visullazing data in higher dimnentions in lower dimensions.

In this repository there is a simple example and an example using the iris dataset
one of the standards datasets for machine learning studing.
The iris file is already normalized and shuffled, the original data and dataset description can be found in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris

AI-Junkie provides a comprehensive description of the algorithm in below.

The package also contains an implementation of dynamic self organising maps in Python. The link to the paper is given below
